The results of the test was PMP caused by ruptured appendiceal myxoma. After intraperitoneal chemotherapy, we performed surgery. We performed right hemicolectomy, low anterior resection, peritoneum excision of the pelvic space, right diaphragm resection, omentectomy, cholecystectomy and splenectomy.

A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted at Bir hospital on patients undergoing Total extra peritoneal inguinal hernia repair under either spinal anesthesia or general anesthesia for inguinal hernia from September 2022 to August 2023. Operative time, postoperative hospitalization time, postoperative pain, postoperative adverse effects, level of satisfaction and recurrence rate at one year was compared.

While seromas are mostly self-absorbed, they can cause discomfort for the patient and complicate the assessment of hernia recurrence. Two primary techniques for managing the hernia sac are sac transection and complete sac reduction. This article aims to evaluate whether sac transection leads to a higher incidence of seroma compared to sac reduction and to review the main preventive strategies for seroma. Four databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane Library) and ClinicalTrials.gov were comprehensively searched for relevant studies. The date of the last search was 25 March 2024. The results reported should include reliable information on seroma incidence, mean operation time, hospital stay and postoperative complications. The present study included 6 studies compared the results of indirect hernia sac transection and complete sac reduction. The pooled results indicated that indirect hernia sac transection was associated increased seroma formation (OR\\u2009=\\u20091.74, 95% CI: 1.35-2.24%), and there was no statistical difference in mean operation time, hospital stay and recurrence between the sac transection (TS) and sac reduction (RS) groups. Postoperative pain was evaluated in 4 studies. There was no statistical difference between the two groups in postoperative pain reported in each of the four articles.

      "\n",
      "1. **Robotic Laparoscopic Assisted Treatment of Inguinal Hernia Containing an Incarcerated Ectopic Pregnancy**\n",
      "   - **Authors:** Nashali Ferrara et al.\n",
      "   - **Journal:** CRSLS: MIS case reports from SLS\n",
      "   - **Summary:** This case report discusses a rare instance of an adult female with a unilateral incarcerated inguinal hernia containing ectopic pregnancy. The patient underwent laparoscopic lysis of adhesions, reduction of the ectopic pregnancy, and unilateral salpingectomy, followed by robotic-assisted transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal hernia repair (rTAPP-IHR). The authors conclude that minimally invasive techniques can be safely employed in such complex cases, highlighting the feasibility and safety of robotic-assisted surgery in this context.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Total Extra Peritoneal Repair of Inguinal Hernia under General Anesthesia Versus Spinal Anesthesia**\n",
      "   - **Authors:** Udita Mishra, Ghanashyam Thapa\n",
      "   - **Journal:** Journal of Nepal Health Research Council\n",
      "   - **Summary:** This prospective cross-sectional study compared outcomes of total extra peritoneal inguinal hernia repair under spinal anesthesia (SA) versus general anesthesia (GA). Fifty-eight patients were analyzed, revealing that while initial postoperative pain scores were lower in the SA group, no significant differences were found in operative time, complications, hospital stay, or recurrence rates. The authors suggest that spinal anesthesia is a viable alternative to general anesthesia, particularly for high-risk patients.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Effect of Sac Transection Versus Sac Reduction on Seroma in Laparoscopic Indirect Hernia Repair: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis**\n",
      "   - **Authors:** Rui Cao, Xiangyu Shao, Junsheng Li\n",
      "   - **Journal:** Hernia: the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery\n",
      "   - **Summary:** This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the incidence of seroma formation in laparoscopic indirect hernia repair using sac transection versus complete sac reduction. The analysis of six studies indicated that sac transection was associated with a higher incidence of seroma (OR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.35-2.24), although no significant differences were noted in operation time, hospital stay, or recurrence rates. The authors conclude that while transection increases seroma risk, it does not elevate other complication rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **A Case of Local Resection and Mesh Repair of the Abdominal Wall to Effectively Treat the Recurrence of Sigmoid Colon Cancer with Spontaneous Perforation in the Inguinal Hernia Sac**\n",
      "   - **Authors:** Kyosuke Agawa et al.\n",
      "   - **Journal:** Gan to kagaku ryoho. Cancer & chemotherapy\n",
      "   - **Summary:** This case report describes a 79-year-old man with a recurrent sigmoid colon cancer tumor in the inguinal hernia sac, which was surgically resected along with abdominal wall reconstruction. Postoperative chemotherapy was administered, and the patient remained free of recurrence one year later. The authors emphasize the importance of surgical intervention in managing painful recurrences impacting quality of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **A Case of Appendiceal Pseudomyxoma Peritonei Diagnosed by Inguinal Hernia and Treated with Multidisciplinary Treatment**\n",
      "   - **Authors:** Akira Sogawa et al.\n",
      "   - **Journal:** Gan to kagaku ryoho. Cancer & chemotherapy\n",
      "   - **Summary:** This case report details a 62-year-old man diagnosed with pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) due to a ruptured appendiceal myxoma presenting as an inguinal hernia. The patient underwent extensive surgical intervention followed by intraperitoneal chemotherapy and hyperthermia treatment. The authors highlight the complexity of PMP management and the necessity for a multidisciplinary approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Overview\n",
      "The articles collectively address various surgical approaches and complications associated with inguinal hernias, including rare presentations such as ectopic pregnancy and malignancies. They emphasize the efficacy of minimally invasive techniques, the comparative safety of different anesthetic modalities, and the implications of surgical techniques on postoperative outcomes like seroma formation. The findings underscore the importance of tailored surgical strategies and multidisciplinary management in complex cases, contributing valuable insights to the field of hernia repair and oncological surgery.\n"
